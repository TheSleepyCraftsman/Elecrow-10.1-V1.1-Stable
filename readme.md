I procured my display from Amazon. The ESP32-P4 included is an early engineering revision (1.3). There are significant differences between the full-rate production version (3.X) and what you can get off of Amazon currently. 

I really wish that the seller would disclose that on the listing. With that said, it's fine for DIY projects. 

I hope this will help you get up and running with a stable baseline to develop from. I have gotten pretty close to how the factory firmware performs. I will document open issues as I go. Currently, I am still experiencing slight screen flickering at higher brightnesses, but it's within the acceptable limits, well, at least for me it it. 

I will eventually upload the following:

ESP32-C6 Firmware Upgrade Directions

Stock ESP32-P4 Firmware Build Directions

This has taken me almost a month to figure out. It would be really nice of Elecrow would actually upload they exact configuration used to compile the factory Firmware as the currently uploaded source code does not produce the exact same BIN files.

### 2, Product version number

|      | Hardware | Software | Remark |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1    | V1.0     | V1.0     | old |
| 1    | V1.1     | V1.1     | old |
| 1    | V1.2     | V1.2     | latest |


**Version 1.1 Update**

The C6 module version 1.1 adds support for 4-wire SDIO communication. Additionally, the arrangement of the SDIO pins has been adjusted, with the pin mappings of the data lines D0–D3 changing from **IO14, IO15, IO16, IO17** to **IO17, IO16, IO15, IO14**. 

**Version 1.2 Update** 

Based on the V1.1 version, V1.2 further optimized the communication stability of the LoRa wireless module. At the same time, the signal pins of the wireless module socket were re-allocated: the original **IO53 and IO54** were adjusted to **IO27 and IO28** respectively, and correspondingly, **IO27 and IO28** were adjusted to **IO53 and IO54** respectively.
